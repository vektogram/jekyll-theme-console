You have seen it on the web. At least if you are a developer, the constant flux of AI generated tools is impressive. There is no doubt that since they became mainstream AI generated apps have become a kind of standard. 

The thing is, what is the problem with them?

Everyone is creating their own version of an existing software, giving it an AI twist.

An AI Chatbot. And AI Calendar, and AI Task Manager, AI Assitant, AI Job Board. The list can go on and on. I see a lot of complaining on this. And those complains surely have their own reasoning.

But we need to again, recognize what we are doing. A lot of us do this because we love tech and programming, but everyone needs to make a living. Thats an absolute truth.

We keep hearing that the need of software is only going to increase in the following future, and I agree with that. If the future is going to be AI generated or hand crafted, that is something i don't know. But we need to solve problems, help businesses and find solutions, no matter the tool used to get there.

Use AI code generations, hand craft your solutions, invent new highly specific tools and frameworks. As long as you are solving a need and the system you are creating lies on top of solid foundations, the origin doesn't matter.
