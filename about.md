# Cesar Camacho — Developer, Analyst, Creative Technologist

I'm a developer with a renewable energy background, driven by the challenge of translating complex business needs into clean, scalable digital solutions. From working on enterprise-grade CMS platforms to agile sprints with design and product teams, I bring technical skill, cross-functional collaboration, and strategic awareness to every role.

After a fulfilling journey at Rackspace Technology, I’m currently on a professional development break—realigning my path toward roles where product thinking meets code craftsmanship.
