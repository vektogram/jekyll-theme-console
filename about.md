# Cesar Camacho — Developer, Analyst, Creative Technologist

I'm a engineer with a renewable energy background, driven by the challenge of doing the work that needs to be done, the one thing that could solve the biggest problems, one at the time.

From working on enterprise-grade CMS platforms to agile sprints with design and product teams, I like to move fast, but restricted by the rules and conventions of the systems we are working on.

After a fulfilling journey at Rackspace Technology, I’m currently on a professional development break, exploring a previous favourite of mine, the Ruby on Rails ecosystem, as well as ecosystems influenced by Rails like the Elixir ecosystem.
